,"The deadly Chicago police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald lasted only a few seconds but the fallout from the grim images, caught on a police dashboard camera, continue to this day.",,main,
,"Since the city released the video on Nov. 24, 2015, it has been viewed by millions, but one person has refused to watch it.",,main,
,"“I don’t think, to this day, that she has watched the video,” said Michael Robbins, one of the attorneys who represented McDonald’s mother, Tina Hunter. “And then of course it became wallpaper, if you will, on the 24-hour news cycle and it went on and on and it’s everywhere. And it drove home her loss.”",,main,
,"Hunter never wanted the video to go public, Robbins said, but she knew it was a possibility.",,main,
,"Attorney Jeffrey Neslund, who also represented Hunter, said the video’s release tortured her.",,main,
,"“You don’t know when it’s going to pop up on the news or in the newspaper, and this is her son,” Neslund said.",,main,
,"Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s administration also didn’t want it to come out, but for different reasons. Officials argued making the video public would compromise investigations into the shooting. But a Cook County judge disagreed and ordered for the video to be released.",,main,
